# World Weather Analysis

**Summary:** This is the challenge project for the Module 6. Three deliverables are required and it is involved the MAPS Directions API to create a fictional app called "PlanMyTrip app". 


**Content:**
  * Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data - Set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. We have the current weather information. *Outputs: Into the [Weather_Database](https://github.com/JackieCortes/World_Weather_Analysis/tree/main/Weather_Database) folder you find: WeatherPy_Database.csv (data) and Weather_Database.ipynb (code file).*

  * Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map - With customer weather preferences are used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. A marker layer created map is generated. *Outputs: Into the [Vacation_Search](https://github.com/JackieCortes/World_Weather_Analysis/tree/main/Vacation_Search) folder: Vacation_Search.ipynb (code file),  WeatherPy_vacation.csv (data) and WeatherPy_vacation_map.png (marker layer map image)*
 
 * Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map - Using the Google Directions API a travel itinerary was created. It is included the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Marker Layers maps are created. *Output:Into the [Vacation_Itinerary](https://github.com/JackieCortes/World_Weather_Analysis/tree/main/Vacation_Itinerary) folder: Vacation_Itinerary.ipynb (code file), WeatherPy_travel_map.png & WeatherPy_travel_map_markers.png (marker layer maps images).*
